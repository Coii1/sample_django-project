🔒 About the SECRET_KEY

Each teammate should generate their own secret key — do not share yours publicly.

They can create one quickly by running:
>>python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
Then paste that into their .env file under:

SECRET_KEY=generated-key-here
